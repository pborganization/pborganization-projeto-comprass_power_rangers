# Comprass - E-commerce App Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the Compras E-commerce app. This document provides an overview of the project, its functionalities, design, and guidelines for development. Please read this document carefully before starting work on the project.

## Description

Compras is an e-commerce app that aims to provide a seamless shopping experience. It includes features such as product search, shopping cart management, and a streamlined purchase process. This project is meant to be implemented by a group of students, with a chosen leader to coordinate efforts.

## Design and API

- **Design**: The design for Compras can be found on Figma [here](https://www.figma.com/file/MfojKHCTpkG1nvhSrzDSEH/Comprass-E-Commecer?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=18Ccdl905V67J2wU-0).
- **API**: The API for product information can be accessed at [https://fakeapi.platzi.com/en/rest/products](https://fakeapi.platzi.com/en/rest/products).

## Functionalities

### 1. Splash Screen

- Upon entering the app, users will go through a loading splash screen to check if they have an active session.
- Users with an active session will be directed to the logged-in home area, while those without a session will still access the home page with some features disabled.
- Ensure that the user's session status is saved locally to maintain state across app launches.

### 2. Home

- Users can search for products by name.
- Clicking on a product will navigate to its details.
- Implement infinite scrolling to display products until reaching the limit of the API.
- Ensure that the cart counter does not go below 0.
- Products should disappear from the cart if the counter reaches 0.

### 3. Profile

- Logged-in users can edit their profile information, and log out.
- Logging out should clear user data, including the authentication token.

### 4. Cart

- Users, whether logged in or logged out, can view and manage items in their cart.
- They can delete or edit the quantity of items in the cart.
- Ensure that the cart counter does not go below 0.
- Items should remain in the cart even if the counter reaches 0; they can only be removed via the delete button.
- Clicking on "BUY" should direct logged-in users to the Checkout area, while logged-out users receive a warning to log in.

### 5. Checkout

- In the Checkout area, users must enter their address, including zip code.
- Implement an API to automatically populate address fields based on the zip code. Users can edit these fields (VIACEP).
- Allow users to add the address even if the zip code is incorrect.
- The zip code API should trigger searches when the full zip code is successfully completed.
- Provide three payment methods: PIX, credit card, and bank slip.
- Users must choose their delivery method. This method is static and does not require an API.

### 6. Success Screen

- Display a success screen based on the selected payment method.
- Ensure that no sensitive data of any individuals is displayed on any screen.
